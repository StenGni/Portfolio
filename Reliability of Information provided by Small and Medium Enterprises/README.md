**BUas · ADS&AI · Analytics Translator Project**  
**Client:** Digiwerkplaats MKB West-Brabant  
**Period:** Sep–Oct 2025  

## Overview  
During this project (09–10/2025) I conducted both a **group** and an **individual** research study on the topic of **Reliability of Information Provided by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**.  

We collected **qualitative** (interviews/focus groups) and **quantitative** (survey) data, and analyzed them through exploratory data analysis and statistical methods.  

This repository includes four key files:  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
- 📄 **Individual Research Paper**  
- 📑 **Policy Paper (group)**  
- 🖼️ **Scientific Poster**  

## Key Findings  
- In-person and website/newsletters are the most trusted communication channels.  
- Social media credibility improves with consistent, transparent communication.  
- **Transparency** (honest advertising, clear pricing, detailed product information) strongly increases trust in SMEs.
